- **Job Matching**: Compares resume content with job descriptions to rank resumes.
- **Machine Learning**: A trained model that improves its prediction over time with more data.

## Tech Stack
- **Python**: For building the app and implementing machine learning algorithms.
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, TfidfVectorizer for NLP.
